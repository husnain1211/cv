This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that can be used to train custom
[YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), [YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6),
[YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
object detection models or a custom [YOLOv5 image classification](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#classification)
model. All notebooks can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),
where you will have access to a free cloud GPU for fast training without special hardware requirements.

The Python script for [classification](https://github.com/maxsitt/yolov5/blob/master/classify/predict.py)
of the captured insect images is available in the custom [`yolov5`](https://github.com/maxsitt/yolov5)
fork and can be used together with the provided `yolov5s-cls_128.onnx` insect classification model.

Use the [`csv_analysis.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/csv_analysis.py)
script for post-processing and analysis of the metadata .csv file with classification results.

## Classification

The modified [classification script](https://github.com/maxsitt/yolov5/blob/master/classify/predict.py)
in the custom [`yolov5`](https://github.com/maxsitt/yolov5) fork includes the following added options:

- `--sort-top1` sort the classified images to folders with the predicted top1 class as folder name
- `--sort-prob` sort images first by probability and then by top1 class (requires --sort-top1)
- `--concat-csv` concatenate all metadata .csv files and append classification results to new columns
- `--new-csv` create a new .csv file with classification results, e.g. if no metadata .csv files are available

More information about deployment of the classification script can be found at the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/) ðŸ“‘.

## Post-processing & analysis

Install the required packages by running:

```
python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The [`csv_analysis.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/csv_analysis.py)
script can be used to automatically post-process and analyze the concatenated metadata .csv
file after the [classification](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/)
step, as it will still contain multiple rows for each tracked insect.

The output of the script includes a final .csv file in which each row corresponds to
an individual tracked insect and its classification result with the overall highest
probability. Additionally, several
[plots](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/analysis/#overview-plots)
are generated that can give a first overview of the analyzed data.

More information about deployment of the analysis script can be found at the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/analysis/) ðŸ“‘.

## Check images

The [`check_images.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/check_images.py)
script can be used to calculate different metrics of the captured images
(e.g. mean/median/min/max width/height) and remove corrupted .jpg images
from the data folder (camera trap output). These are rarely generated by
the automated monitoring script and will cause an error while running the
classification script.
