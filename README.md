This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that can be used to train custom
[YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), [YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6),
[YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
object detection models or a custom YOLOv5 [image classification](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5#classification)
model. All notebooks can be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/),
where you will have access to a free cloud GPU for fast training without special hardware requirements.

You will also find Python scripts for classification ([`predict_mod.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/predict_mod.py))
of insect images (e.g. [cropped detections](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/detection/#processing-pipeline))
and analysis ([`csv_analysis.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/csv_analysis.py))
of the [metadata .csv](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/detection/#metadata-csv)
files, which are generated as output from the Insect Detect DIY camera trap.

The notebooks for detection model training also include all necessary steps to convert your model
to [.blob format](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/model_conversion/) for on-device inference
with the [Luxonis OAK](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1093.html) cameras.

The notebook for classification model training includes [export](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/251)
to [ONNX format](https://onnx.ai/) for faster CPU inference on your local PC.

## Classification

The classification script [`predict_mod.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/predict_mod.py)
is a modified version of the [`predict.py`](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/classify/predict.py)
script from the [YOLOv5 repo](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/classify),
with the following added options:

- `--concat-csv` to concatenate metadata .csv files and append classification results to new columns
- `--new-csv` to create a new .csv file with classification results, e.g. if no metadata .csv files are available
- `--sort-top1` to sort classified images to folders with predicted top1 class as folder name

More information about deployment of the classification script on your PC can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/) ðŸ“‘.

## Analysis

The analysis script [`csv_analysis.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml/blob/main/csv_analysis.py)
can be used to automatically post-process and analyze the concatenated metadata .csv
file after the [classification](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/)
step, as it will still contain multiple rows for each tracked insect.
Running the script will yield a .csv file in which each row corresponds to an
individual tracked insect and its classification result with the overall highest
probability. Additionally, several
[plots](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/analysis/#overview-plots)
are generated that can give a first overview of the analyzed data.

More information about deployment of the analysis script can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/analysis/) ðŸ“‘.
